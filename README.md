# Analysis of open data on housing and health

## Project Description
The NDL's Topic 6 analysis focuses on the relationship between housing quality and health outcomes. As a compliment to the labs' analysis of regional trends and specific interventions, the central HF team hopes to create an up-to-date national picture of relevant housing and health indicators.
